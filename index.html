      <p>
        Iâ€™m here to create, enjoy life, and empower others to do the same. I'm currently the founder of Sika Education, an education company focused on personalized learning and outcomes-based software engineering education. Previously, I was the Director of Education for Flatiron School, the Faculty Director for Galvanize, and Executive Director of Develop Denver.

        I want to be a software engineer because I view software engineering as one of the most powerful forms of creation. As a musician, I'm limited to creating sounds; with software, I can make almost anything I can imagine. Furthermore, it's never been easier to reach a global audience with software. I look forward to using my software engineering skills to make learning and teaching easier than ever!
